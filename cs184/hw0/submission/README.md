# CS 184: Homework 0, Programming Component

## Files
```hw0.py```
This file contains all the code for problem 6 of the homework. The first block contains part 1 of this problem, where we define the relevant matrices and vectors and use numpy to compute the inverse of A and the matrix products requested. The second block contains part 2 of this problem, where we first simulate draws from the standard normal distribution and plot the empirical CDF and then we plot the empirical CDF obtained by drawing from the Y random variable defined in the problem statement. We plot these empirical CDFs together and show the result.
